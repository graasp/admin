## 🏠 A Fresh New Homepage

## 🌐 Single Origin Improvements

The backend API now operates under a single origin: **graasp.org/api**. This simplifies development and improves overall platform consistency. It shouldn't have break anything. If you notice any problem, please contact us.

We plan to move the Library to **graasp.org/library** as well.

## ⚙️ Backend Optimizations

We’ve implemented several performance and stability improvements:

- Better environment variable handling for **H5P** and **shortlinks**
- Faster **app data** and **parents** endpoints
- More reliable **membership updates**

These updates ensure smoother and faster interactions across the platform.

## 🛠️ Admin Enhancements

For administrators, we’ve added:

- Maintenance setup improvements
- Various other refinements
