## Library home page

The home page of the library has been revamped to offer more diverse sections to help users find what they are looking for.

Let us know what you think about it!

## User survey

We are currently running a user survey to gather feedback on our platform. Your input is valuable to us and will help us improve our services. Please take a few minutes to complete the survey at [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSSD8oPlpvLvX1YPDfvfDGQzV7zqqPoSEhkItIZ8pIAPCpTw/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSSD8oPlpvLvX1YPDfvfDGQzV7zqqPoSEhkItIZ8pIAPCpTw/viewform).

## Bug fixes and improvements

In this release we have fixed a few bugs and made some improvements.

### Returning thumbnails with search results

Previously when searching for items, the thumbnails were fetched after the results were available, creating a slight delay and unnecessary waterfall queries. Now we provide thumbnails alongside the search results. This should improve the speed feeling when searching the library as well as improve performance.

### Responsiveness/design improvements

We have made some small changes to improve responsiveness of the menus on the landing page.

The language switch design has been upgraded to improve its appearance.

### Performance improvements

We have made some performance improvements to resource heavy requests in the backend.

Please let us know if you encounter any lags or recurring performance issues. We are always looking to provide the best experience to our users.
