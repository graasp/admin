## Automatic Clean Up of your Trash

From now on, items trashed more than 3 months ago are now automatically deleted. This will save you storage and nicely clear your trash.

## Various Fixes & Improvements

- Prevent an error when creating a tag with trailing spaces
- Display a clear error message when a password is incorrect
- Optimized the left-hand side item navigation
- Fixed a validation issue affecting thumbnails during publication
- Updated the Library translations, allowing the interface to correctly display more than 1,000 collections
- Resolved a crash that could occur when an item had a short link. Thanks to one of our active users for reporting this! 🙌  
  As always, if you run into anything unexpected, don’t hesitate to report it. Your feedback helps us make Graasp better for everyone.
