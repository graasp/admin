#Â Behaviors

- On load:
  - without item id:
    - without allowed geolocation and geolocation disabled: show the country form to choose a focus. Choosing a country will prevent loading lots of item at the same time.
    - with allowed geolocation: show the current position
  - with item id:
    - the item does not have a geolocation and geolocation disabled: show country form
    - the item has a geolocation (current or children): fit bounds of the map
    - the item does not have a geolocation but geolocation enabled: show the current position

If the user is logged out, geocoding and reverse geocoding are disabled.
